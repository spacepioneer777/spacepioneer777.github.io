<p><strong>Setup instructions for SMD Lunar Solo tent</strong></p>
<p>Choose a campsite away from low hanging branches, and clear the ground of sharp objects such as sticks or rocks. Choose a site where water will drain away from the shelter. Avoid contact of the tent&rsquo;s floor with sharp or abrasive objects. The use of a footprint is recommended. Six Moon Designs offers Tyvek or Polycro footprints in various sizes.</p>
<p>The tent will be spread on the ground after searching and cleaning the campsite. If possible, the back of the shelter should point in the wind. All loops and guying points should be loosened, the two entrances should be closed.</p>

<p>1) First tighten the two side straps at the front</p>
<p>2) Then you go to the back and put the middle guy back and then the middle string on the front, which later sets up the entrance and holds. Secure this with sufficient distance to the tent.</p>
<p>3) The two lateral guying points on the back are attached</p>
<p>4) Now you set his walking stick to about 125cm and leads him, with the tip ahead, at the entrance to the reinforcement in the "black hat" and sets up the pole. At the bottom is a tab to which a rubber loop is attached. This loop leads around the handle of the stick. This is the tent pole and the tent is built.</p>
<p>5) Once around go and do some finetuning of the bracing. After a while (1 hour or when wet) then a little re-tensioning.</p>

<p><strong>Notes: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Allow a half hour for the material to relax then re-tension as needed.</li>
<li>For increased stability in windy conditions, and more interior space there are additional tie outs on both sides of the shelter.</li>
